# LiftMechanics
LiftMechanics is a Minecraft datapack that lets the player build lifts that move block by block. They are available in four different sizes and can be combined with Redstone contraptions.

## Features:
- The datapack allows you to build lifts in four sizes up to 5x5 blocks wide.
- The datapack allows redstone to interact with elevators through redstone lights.
- A lifts can be automatically stopped at the next floor if it is marked with an observer.
- A lifts stops when something is in its path and does not destroy a built.

## Warning:
You cannot duplicate blocks or items. A lift uses the previously placed or given chains and will stop working if a block is placed incorrectly above or below it.
But be aware that all items and XP that lay on a lift will be lost when the lift moves, to protect e.g. the furnace against item duplication.
