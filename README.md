# LiftMechanics
LiftMechanics is a Minecraft datapack that lets the player build lifts that move block by block. They are available in four different sizes and can be combined with Redstone contraptions. There may be faster travel options, but you can build your own epic looking platforms and bring your buildings to life, or you can move larger block structures like small rooms.  
See [LiftMechanics on planetminecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/lift-mechanics/).

## Features:
- The datapack allows you to build lifts in four sizes up to 5x5 blocks wide.
- The datapack allows redstone to interact with lifts through redstone lamps.
- A lifts can be automatically stopped at the next floor if it is marked with an observer.
- A lifts stops when something is in its path and does not destroy a built.

## Usage:
The basic usage is as follows:
To build a lift, you must first build a platform of 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 or 5x5 block size. Now place chains of at least 4 blocks height in the corners and above them containers like hoppers or dispensers. After a right click on one of the containers the lift is activated. If it needs to move down from its current position, place 4 chains per block in the container that the lift should be able to move down. If you now sneak or jump, the lift moves one block down or up.
